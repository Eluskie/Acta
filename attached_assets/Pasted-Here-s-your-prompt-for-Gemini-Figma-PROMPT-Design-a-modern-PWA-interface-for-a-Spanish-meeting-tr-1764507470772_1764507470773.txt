Here's your prompt for Gemini/Figma:

PROMPT:
Design a modern PWA interface for a Spanish meeting transcription app called "Acta" (or suggest a better name). The app helps community meeting secretaries record, transcribe, and send official meeting minutes via email.
Design Direction:

Aesthetic inspiration: Granola.ai meets Descript
Modern, warm, trustworthy professional tool
Target users: 45-65 year old Spanish secretaries with low tech literacy
Must feel governmental/official but approachable and simple

Color Palette:

Primary: Deep blue or forest green (trust, professionalism)
Accent: Warm amber or coral (friendly, action)
Backgrounds: Warm cream/off-white, not pure white
Text: Warm dark grays, high contrast for readability
Success states: Soft green
Recording state: Pulsing red/amber

Typography:

Headings: Inter or similar modern sans-serif, bold weights
Body: Clean, highly readable, 16px minimum
All text in Spanish
Generous line height (1.6-1.8)

Key Screens to Design (Desktop/Tablet optimized, mobile-friendly):

Dashboard/Home

Large centered "Nueva Acta" button (primary CTA, ~200px wide)
Below: Grid/list of recent meetings (cards with building name, date, status)
Top bar: App logo, search, user avatar
Empty state: Beautiful illustration + "Comienza tu primera acta"


Recording Screen

Fullscreen/focused mode
Center: Large pulsing circle or waveform visualization
Top: Building name, attendees count
Center bottom: Timer (MM:SS format, large)
Bottom controls: Large Pause button, Stop button (destructive red)
Minimal chrome, maximum focus


Review/Edit Screen

Split layout (60/40)
Left: Editable transcript (clean typography, click-to-edit inline)
Right: Live preview of formatted "Acta" document (with Spanish legal format)
Bottom: Audio player (Descript-style waveform, play/pause, timeline)
Top right: "Generar Acta" primary button


Send Screen

Top: Preview card of generated PDF acta (with shadow, elegant)
Middle: Email recipient chips (Gmail-style, drag to reorder)
Subject line field (pre-filled, editable)
Bottom: Large "Enviar Acta" button
Success state: Smooth checkmark animation + "Acta enviada correctamente"



UI Components to Include:

Large touch-friendly buttons (min 48px height)
Cards with subtle shadows (4-8px blur)
Status badges (Grabando, Procesando, Enviado)
Progress indicators (when processing transcription)
Generous padding (24-32px margins)
Smooth transitions and micro-interactions

Additional Considerations:

Include beautiful empty states with illustrations
Show loading states (skeleton screens, not spinners)
Design for both light mode only (simpler for MVP)
Iconography: Phosphor icons or Lucide (outline style, not filled)
Accessibility: WCAG AA contrast ratios minimum

Overall Vibe:

Calm and confident, not playful
Spacious and breathing room, not dense
One primary action per screen
Clear hierarchy, obvious next steps
Professional but human

Output Format:

Figma frames or screens
Include hover/active states for buttons
Show mobile responsive breakpoints if possible
Annotate key measurements and spacing
